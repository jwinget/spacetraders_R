# Roadmap
* NO BLOCKING CODE. All requests are submitted to a queue instantly and state is tracked in the background
  - Likely need to write a scheduler and change existing functions to use it
  - Ideally remove dependencies for `future` and `furrr`
* More efficient mining loop that takes advantage of faster/larger haulers
* Add functions for navigation, exploration, and market analysis
* Permanent storage for data market, charts, ships (anything else?)
  - local sqlite database
  - UI fed by local DB, not by API calls
* More granular control over ships and/or ship groupings
* UI overhaul to display and control all of that stuff
